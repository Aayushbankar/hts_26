#  Aayush's Complete Task List — Silent-Protocol

**Role:** Lead Engineer + Core Logic + Team Glue
**Total Estimated Time:** ~16 hours (core work + team lead duties)

---

## Phase 0: Repo & Project Setup (1 hour) //done

> You do this FIRST, before anyone else touches anything.

- [ ] **0.1** Create the project folder structure (5 min)
  - `/backend` (Aum's workspace)
  - `/frontend` (Divya's workspace)
  - `/core` (your workspace)
  - `/docs` (already done )
- [ ] **0.2** Initialize Git repo and push to GitHub (10 min)
- [ ] **0.3** Invite Divya and Aum as collaborators on GitHub (5 min)
- [ ] **0.4** Create `backend/requirements.txt` with all dependencies (5 min)
- [ ] **0.5** Create `backend/.env.example` with `GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here` as template (5 min)
- [ ] **0.6** Create `frontend/index.html` + `frontend/style.css` + `frontend/script.js` as empty starter files (5 min)
- [ ] **0.7** Create `core/__init__.py` (empty, so Python can import from it) (2 min)
- [ ] **0.8** Create a basic `README.md` with project name, one-liner, and "How to Run" skeleton (10 min)
- [ ] **0.9** Push everything, share repo link with team (5 min)
- [ ] **0.10** Walk Divya through: clone → open `frontend/` → start Live Server (5 min)
- [ ] **0.11** Walk Aum through: clone → create venv → pip install → get Groq key → save `.env` (5 min)

** Checkpoint:** Both teammates have the repo cloned and can see their starter files.

---

## Phase 1: Core Logic — AliasManager (1.5 hours)

- [ ] **1.1** Create `core/alias_manager.py` with the `AliasManager` class (10 min)
- [ ] **1.2** Implement `__init__()`: empty `real_to_fake`, `fake_to_real` dicts, Faker instance (5 min)
- [ ] **1.3** Implement `_generate_fake(label)`: the Faker mapping table for all 11 entity types + default fallback (20 min)
- [ ] **1.4** Implement `get_or_create(entity_text, entity_label)`: check existing → generate if new → store both ways → handle collisions (20 min)
- [ ] **1.5** Implement `sanitize(text, entities)`: sort by length (longest first!) → loop → replace (15 min)
- [ ] **1.6** Implement `desanitize(text)`: sort fake_to_real by fake length (longest first!) → loop → replace (10 min)
- [ ] **1.7** Implement `get_mapping()` and `clear()` (5 min)
- [ ] **1.8** Quick manual test: create instance, add "Apple"→ORG twice → confirm same alias (5 min)

** Checkpoint:** AliasManager works standalone. Aliases are consistent, bidirectional, and collision-free.

---

## Phase 2: Core Logic — Sanitizer (1 hour)

- [ ] **2.1** Install GLiNER and Faker: `pip install gliner faker` (5 min)
- [ ] **2.2** First-run: download the GLiNER model (~500MB). Wait for it to cache. (10 min)
- [ ] **2.3** Create `core/sanitizer.py` with the `Sanitizer` class (10 min)
- [ ] **2.4** Implement `__init__()`: load GLiNER model, create AliasManager, define labels list (10 min)
- [ ] **2.5** Implement `sanitize_prompt(user_prompt)`: run `predict_entities()` → pass to `alias_manager.sanitize()` → return (sanitized_text, entities) (15 min)
- [ ] **2.6** Implement `desanitize_response(llm_response)`: delegate to `alias_manager.desanitize()` (5 min)
- [ ] **2.7** Implement `get_alias_map()`: delegate to `alias_manager.get_mapping()` (5 min)

** Checkpoint:** `Sanitizer("Tim Cook works at Apple")` → returns sanitized text with 0 real names.

---

## Phase 3: Test Script (45 min)

- [ ] **3.1** Create `core/test_sanitizer.py` (5 min)
- [ ] **3.2** Test 1 — Basic: sanitize a sentence with 3+ entities, verify none leak through (10 min)
- [ ] **3.3** Test 2 — Desanitize: sanitize → simulate LLM response → desanitize → verify real names restored (10 min)
- [ ] **3.4** Test 3 — Consistency: sanitize "Apple" in two messages → same alias (10 min)
- [ ] **3.5** Test 4 — Partial match: "Apple Inc" vs "Apple" — verify longest-first sorting works (10 min)
- [ ] **3.6** Run all tests → fix any failures → commit and push (5 min)

** Checkpoint:** `python test_sanitizer.py` → "ALL TESTS PASSED". Push to Git. Tell Aum to pull.

- [ ] **4.4** No-entity prompt: "What is 2+2?" — should pass through unchanged (5 min)
- [ ] **4.5** Multi-turn: sanitize 3 messages mentioning "Apple" → same alias all 3 times (10 min)
- [ ] **4.6** Document any entity types GLiNER misses → decide if regex fallback needed (15 min)

** Checkpoint:** Core logic handles all prompt types. Known limitations documented.
